At Data Geekery, we love Java and we're excited about all the goodies
that Java 8 will bring to our ecosystem. We've blogged about Java 8
extensively, and with this project, we'd like to share a couple of
awesome examples with you, the Java community.

To set up this project, simply import it into IntelliJ IDEA 13.0,
which you can get from here:
